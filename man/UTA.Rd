  criteriaMinMax,

  epsilon,
  alternativesRanks = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{performanceTable}{Matrix or data frame containing the performance
table. Each row corresponds to an alternative, and each column to a
criterion. Rows (resp. columns) must be named according to the IDs of the
alternatives (resp. criteria).}

\item{criteriaMinMax}{Vector containing the preference direction on each of
the criteria. "min" (resp. "max") indicates that the criterion has to be
minimized (maximized). The elements are named according to the IDs of the
criteria.}

\item{criteriaNumberOfBreakPoints}{Vector containing the number of
breakpoints of the piecewise linear value functions to be determined.
Minimum 2. The elements are named according to the IDs of the criteria.}

\item{epsilon}{Numeric value containing the minimal difference in value
between two consecutive alternatives in the final ranking.}

\item{alternativesRanks}{Optional vector containing the ranks of the
alternatives. The elements are named according to the IDs of the
alternatives. If not present, then at least one of alternativesPreferences
or alternativesIndifferences should be given.}

\item{alternativesPreferences}{Optional matrix containing the preference
constraints on the alternatives. Each line of the matrix corresponds to a
constraint of the type alternative a is strictly preferred to alternative b.
If not present, then either alternativesRanks or alternativesIndifferences
should be given.}

\item{alternativesIndifferences}{Optional matrix containing the indifference
constraints on the alternatives. Each line of the matrix corresponds to a
constraint of the type alternative a is indifferent to alternative b. If not
present, then either alternativesRanks or alternativesPreferences should be
given.}

\item{criteriaLBs}{Vector containing the lower bounds of the criteria to be
considered for the elicitation of the value functions. If not specified, the
lower bounds present in the performance table are taken.}

\item{criteriaUBs}{Vector containing the upper bounds of the criteria to be
considered for the elicitation of the value functions. If not specified, the
upper bounds present in the performance table are taken.}

\item{alternativesIDs}{Vector containing IDs of alternatives, according to
which the datashould be filtered.}

\item{criteriaIDs}{Vector containing IDs of criteria, according to which the
data should be filtered.}

\item{kPostOptimality}{A small positive threshold used during the
postoptimality analysis (see article on UTA by Siskos and Lagreze in EJOR,
1982). If not specified, no postoptimality analysis is performed.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list structured as follows :
\item{optimum}{The value of the objective function.} \item{valueFunctions}{A
list containing the value functions which have been determined. Each value
function is defined by a matrix of breakpoints, where the first row
corresponds to the abscissa (row labelled "x") and where the second row
corresponds to the ordinate (row labelled "y").} \item{overallValues}{A
vector of the overall values of the input alternatives.} \item{ranks}{A
vector of the ranks of the alternatives obtained via the elicited value
functions. Ties method = "min".} \item{Kendall}{Kendall's tau between the
input ranking and the one obtained via the elicited value functions. NULL if
no input ranking is given but alternativesPreferences or
alternativesIndifferences.} \item{errors}{A vector of the errors (sigma)
which have to be added to the overall values of the alternatives in order to
respect the input ranking.} \item{minimumWeightsPO}{In case a
post-optimality analysis is performed, the minimal weight of each criterion,
else NULL.} \item{maximumWeightsPO}{In case a post-optimality analysis is
performed, the maximal weight of each criterion, else NULL.}
\item{averageValueFunctionsPO}{In case a post-optimality analysis is
performed, average value functions respecting the input ranking, else NULL.}
