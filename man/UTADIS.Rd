\title{UTADIS method to elicit value functions in view of sorting alternatives in
ordered categories}
\usage{
UTADIS(
  performanceTable,
  criteriaMinMax,
  criteriaNumberOfBreakPoints,
  alternativesAssignments,
  categoriesRanks,
  epsilon,
  criteriaLBs = NULL,
  criteriaUBs = NULL,
  alternativesIDs = NULL,
  criteriaIDs = NULL,
  categoriesIDs = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{performanceTable}{Matrix or data frame containing the performance
table. Each row corresponds to an alternative, and each column to a
criterion. Rows (resp. columns) must be named according to the IDs of the
alternatives (resp. criteria).}

\item{criteriaMinMax}{Vector containing the preference direction on each of
the criteria. "min" (resp. "max") indicates that the criterion has to be
minimized (maximized). The elements are named according to the IDs of the
criteria.}

\item{criteriaNumberOfBreakPoints}{Vector containing the number of
breakpoints of the piecewise linear value functions to be determined.
Minimum 2. The elements are named according to the IDs of the criteria.}

\item{alternativesAssignments}{Vector containing the assignments of the
alternatives to categories. Minimum 2 categories. The elements of the vector
are named according to the IDs of the alternatives.}

\item{categoriesRanks}{Vector containing the ranks of the categories.
Minimum 2 categories. The elements of the vector are named according to the
IDs of the categories.}

\item{epsilon}{Numeric value containing the minimal difference in value
between the upper bound of a category and an alternative of that category.}

\item{criteriaLBs}{Vector containing the lower bounds of the criteria to be
considered for the elicitation of the value functions. If not specified, the
lower bounds present in the performance table are taken.}

\item{criteriaUBs}{Vector containing the upper bounds of the criteria to be
considered for the elicitation of the value functions. If not specified, the
upper bounds present in the performance table are taken.}

\item{alternativesIDs}{Vector containing IDs of alternatives, according to
which the datashould be filtered.}

\item{criteriaIDs}{Vector containing IDs of criteria, according to which the
data should be filtered.}

\item{categoriesIDs}{Vector containing IDs of categories, according to which
the data should be filtered.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list structured as follows :
\item{optimum}{The value of the objective function.} \item{valueFunctions}{A
list containing the value functions which have been determined. Each value
function is defined by a matrix of breakpoints, where the first row
corresponds to the abscissa (row labelled "x") and where the second row
corresponds to the ordinate (row labelled "y").} \item{overallValues}{A
vector of the overall values of the input alternatives.}
\item{categoriesLBs}{A vector containing the lower bounds of the considered
categories.} \item{errors}{A list containing the errors (sigmaPlus and
sigmaMinus) which have to be substracted and added to the overall values of
the alternatives in order to respect the input ranking.}
