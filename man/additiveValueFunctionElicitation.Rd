\usage{
additiveValueFunctionElicitation(
  performanceTable,
  criteriaMinMax,
  epsilon,
  alternativesRanks = NULL,
  alternativesPreferences = NULL,
  alternativesIndifferences = NULL,
  alternativesIDs = NULL,
  criteriaIDs = NULL

}
\arguments{
\item{performanceTable}{Matrix or data frame containing the performance
table. Each row corresponds to an alternative, and each column to a
criterion. Rows (resp. columns) must be named according to the IDs of the
alternatives (resp. criteria).}

\item{criteriaMinMax}{Vector containing the preference direction on each of
the criteria. "min" (resp. "max") indicates that the criterion has to be
minimized (maximized). The elements are named according to the IDs of the
criteria.}

\item{epsilon}{Numeric value containing the minimal difference in value
between two consecutive alternatives in the final ranking.}

\item{alternativesRanks}{Optional vector containing the ranks of the
alternatives. The elements are named according to the IDs of the
alternatives. If not present, then at least one of alternativesPreferences
or alternativesIndifferences should be given.}

\item{alternativesPreferences}{Optional matrix containing the preference
constraints on the alternatives. Each line of the matrix corresponds to a
constraint of the type alternative a is strictly preferred to alternative b.
If not present, then either alternativesRanks or alternativesIndifferences
should be given.}

\item{alternativesIndifferences}{Optional matrix containing the indifference
constraints on the alternatives. Each line of the matrix corresponds to a
constraint of the type alternative a is indifferent to alternative b. If not
present, then either alternativesRanks or alternativesPreferences should be
given.}

\item{alternativesIDs}{Vector containing IDs of alternatives, according to
which the datashould be filtered.}

\item{criteriaIDs}{Vector containing IDs of criteria, according to which the
data should be filtered.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list structured as follows :
\item{optimum}{The value of the objective function.} \item{valueFunctions}{A
list containing the value functions which have been determined. Each value
function is defined by a matrix of breakpoints, where the first row
corresponds to the abscissa (row labelled "x") and where the second row
corresponds to the ordinate (row labelled "y").} \item{overallValues}{A
vector containing the overall values of the input alternatives.}
\item{ranks}{A vector containing the ranks of the alternatives obtained via
the elicited value functions. Ties method = "min".} \item{Kendall}{Kendall's
tau between the input ranking and the one obtained via the elicited value
functions.} \item{errors}{The errors (sigma) which have to be added to the
overall values of the alternatives in order to respect the input ranking.}
}

Elicits a general additive value function from a ranking of alternatives.
