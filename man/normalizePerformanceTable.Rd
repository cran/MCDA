\title{Function to normalize (or rescale) the columns (or criteria) of a
performance table.}
\usage{
normalizePerformanceTable(
  performanceTable,
  normalizationTypes = NULL,
  alternativesIDs = NULL,
  criteriaIDs = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{performanceTable}{A matrix containing the performance table to be
plotted. The columns are labelled according to the criteria IDs, and the
rows according to the alternatives IDs.}

\item{normalizationTypes}{Vector indicating the type of normalization that
should be applied to each of the criteria. Possible values :
"percentageOfMax", "rescaling" (minimum becomes 0, maximum becomes 1),
"standardization" (rescale to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1),
"scaleToUnitLength" (scale the criteria values such that the column has
euclidian length 1). Any other value (like "none") will result in no data
transformation. The elements are named according to the IDs of the criteria.}

\item{alternativesIDs}{Vector containing IDs of alternatives, according to
which the data should be filtered.}

\item{criteriaIDs}{Vector containing IDs of criteria, according to which the
data should be filtered.}
}
\description{
Standardizes the range of the criteria according to a few methods :
percentage of max, scale between 0 and 1, scale to 0 mean and 1 standard
deviation, scale to euclidian unit length.
