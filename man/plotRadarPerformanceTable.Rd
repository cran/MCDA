\title{Function to plot radar plots of alternatives of a performance table.}
\usage{
plotRadarPerformanceTable(
  performanceTable,
  criteriaMinMax = NULL,
  alternativesIDs = NULL,
  criteriaIDs = NULL,
  overlay = FALSE,
  bw = FALSE,
  lwd = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{performanceTable}{A matrix containing the performance table to be
plotted. The columns are labelled according to the criteria IDs, and the
rows according to the alternatives IDs.}

\item{criteriaMinMax}{Vector indicating whether criteria should be minimized
or maximized. If it is given, a "higher" value in the radar plot corresponds
to a more preferred value according to the decision maker. "min" (resp.
"max") indicates that the criterion has to be minimized (maximized). The
elements are named according to the IDs of the criteria.}

\item{alternativesIDs}{Vector containing IDs of alternatives, according to
which the data should be filtered.}

\item{criteriaIDs}{Vector containing IDs of criteria, according to which the
data should be filtered.}

\item{overlay}{Boolean value indicating if the plots should be overlayed on
one plot (TRUE), or not (FALSE)}

\item{bw}{Boolean value indicating if the plots should be in black/white
(TRUE) or color (FALSE)}

\item{lwd}{Value indicating the line width of the plot.}
}
\description{
Plots radar plots of alternatives contained in a performance table, either
in one radar plot, or on multiple radar plots. For a given alternative, the
plot shows how far above/below average (the thick black line) each of the
criteria performances values are (average taken w.r.t. to the filtered
performance table).
